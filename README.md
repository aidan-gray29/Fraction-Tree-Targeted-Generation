# Fraction-Tree-Targeted-Generation
 Given an input fraction M/N , this algorithm generates a Stern-Brocott tree to find the first fraction less than or equal to the square root of the input fraction.
 The Stern-Brocott tree is infinite in size and contains all rational numbers. This program uses a constant memory size while traversing branches of the tree in a targeted manner.
